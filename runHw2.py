    # you are asked to implement. In some cases, your submissions will be 
    # auto-graded.  Thus, it is critical that you adhere to all the specified 
    # function signatures.
    #
    # Before your submission, make sure you can run runHw2('all') 
    # without any error.
    #
    # Usage:
    # python runHw2.py                  : list all the registered functions
    # python runHw2.py 'function_name'  : execute a specific test
    # python runHw2.py 'all'            : execute all the registered functions
